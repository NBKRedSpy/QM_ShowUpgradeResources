Ever been in the dungeon and trying to remember if a resource is still needed for Magnum upgrades?

This mod simplifies the process by adding a green arrow to any resource items that are still needed for Magnum upgrades.
The tooltip for the item also includes a "Needs X:" line which indicates how many of that resource is still needed.
