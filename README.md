# Quasimorph Show Needed Upgrade Resources

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)


## Important! Opt In Beta Only

Unfortunately this mod is only available for the Quasimorph's opt in beta, not the current release.

# Docs
Ever been in the dungeon and trying to remember if a resource is still needed for Magnum upgrades?

This mod simplifies the process by adding a green arrow to any resource items that are still needed for Magnum upgrades.
The tooltip for the item also includes a "Needs X:" line which indicates how many of that resource is still needed.

When in a raid, the green arrow will show for resources that need an upgrade *and* there is not enough already in the ship's cargo.
This does not change when an item is picked up.

When on the space ship, the green arrow will always show if a future upgrade needs the resource.
